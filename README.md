# Thirukkural

### A modern website to read and learn the Thirukkural.

## About 

Thirukkural (or Kural) is an ancient philosophical tamil text written by Thiruvalluvar (or Valluvar). The prefix "Thiru" is similar to that of "honorable" or "respected". It is a text made up of 3 texts each describing the three important aspects of life: Virtue, Wealth, and Love. It has a total of 1330 couplets just 7 words each. Reading one of these couplets per day will provide people with a new perspective on life and will guide them to live meaningful lives.

When people talk about philosophy, they talk about Kant, Plato, or some other modern philosophers, but Tamil philosophy is ancient, vast, and mature. It is one of the most important texts of humanity that needs to be preserved. I hope through this website, people are able to read at least one kural per day and explore more of Tamil philoshophy and literature.

## Codebase & Technology

The webiste is built using `Next.js` and is hosted on `Vercel`. The data for the Kural's was retrieved from [tk120404's repo](https://github.com/tk120404/thirukkural/). The explanations can be a bit cryptic in the beginning so I'm slowly manually changing the explanations to simpler language. The ones that have been manually verified will have a checkmark.
